## User experience (UX)

Zero waste design wants to inspire people to use fabric scraps in their creativity.  Most fabric scraps are often thrown away but could be used to create useful and beautiful items instead. Workshops are arranged once a month with a lot of fabric scraps to choose from and a chance to get inspired by each other.

## Design

This is my first project and it was made with a lack of time. The design has been influenced by the “Love running”-project at Code Institute. I wanted to create a clean looking website with colors that didn't stand out and blend in well with the inspirational images. My aim was also a solid foundation to work with in upcoming changes and improvements. Mostly improvements in the design because it's a bit simple now.

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](assets/images/readme-images/color-scheme-zero-waste-design.png)

The color palette was created using [Colorminds](http://colormind.io/)


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. 

I used a combination of Roboto (300) and Roboto slab for the headings. I like the mix of serif and sans-serif. 

### Imagery

Most of the images are my own (things that I've made with fabric scraps) except the image on the workshop page which is from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

### Wireframes

I didn´t use any Wireframes because there wasn´t enough time to learn another new thing at this point. Instead I went old school and used pen and papper.

## Features

Zero waste design is a website with four pages. 
Three of the pages are accessible from the navigation menu.
- Home page, with information about zero waste design and the material that is used.
- Portfolio, with images of items that was created with fabric scraps.
- Workshops, with dates and sign up form. 
The fourth page is a thank you page thats is shown when a user submits the form on the workshop page.

### Header and navigation 
![Header and hero image](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-header-hero.jpg)

The header consists of a logo and the navigation menu. Easy for the user to see what pages are on the website and to alter between them.
The hero header contains an image of products made of fabric scraps and some text what this website is about.

### Fabric information
![Fabric information](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-material-info.jpg)

Information about the fabrics that is used in the designs and in the workshops. Good information for the user to know. 

### Portfolio 
![Portfolio](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-portfolio.jpg)

Images showing designs made of fabric scraps. Inspirational for the user to see what you can create with fabric scraps.

### Workshops
![Workshops](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-workshop.jpg)

The first section of the workshop page shows the dates and place for the workshops that the users can choose from. It also consists an image at the top. 

![Workshop form](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-form.jpg)

The second section of the workshop page contains a sign up form for the workshops. The user can fill in which date they want to attend the workshop and have to fill in name and email address.

### Thank you page
![Form thank you page](assets/images/readme-images/zero-waste-design-thankyou-page.jpg)

The thank you page shows a message to user that submit the sign up form. The user get information that message has been recieved and that they will get more information about the workshops. 

### Footer

### General features on each page

All pages have
- A responsive navigation bar and the logo at the top. 
- A footer which contains social media icon links.

### Future Implementations

- A page about the person running the Zero waste design website and contact info.
- A fully functional sign up form. 

### Accessibility

For the accessibility this was used:
- Semantic HTML.
- Alt attributes on images
- Sufficient colour contrast.
- Marking the current page as active.

## Testing

- Chrome developer tools was used to find any issues while building the website. 

- The W3C validators for HTML and CSS was used when the website was finsihed. No errors on CSS and a few errors on HTML-pages but this was solved. See details below on Solved bugs. 

- Lighthouse testing

![Lighthouse testing](assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-testing-zero-waste-design.png)

### Solved bugs

1. Menu navigation elements in the wrong order. 
 Solution: Serched W3 schools for an solution for this and found that I should use [flex-end](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_justify-content_flex-end
)

2. Responsive issues images. The hero header and one of the images in the about materials sections was cropped on smaller screens. 
Solution: The third image on the page had a width that was bigger then tha screen and affected the other images. To change that width from px to % on smaller screen changed that. Got help from Code institute tutor team on this one. 

3. Responsive issues navigation bar. On smaller screens the nav bar "got hidden" by the hero image. 
Solution: Removed float:left on the logo. Got help from Code institute tutor team on this one. 

4. W3C Validator pointed out one thing on index.html - "section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed."
Solution: Didn¨t like the layout I first created so changed it and also added a heading. 

5. W3C validator pointed out one thing on portfolio.html - "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed."
Solution: Changed section to div because didn't want a heading.

6. W3C validator pointed out four things on workshops.html - 
- "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed."
Solution: Changed section to div because didn't want a heading.

- "Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty."
Solution: Was empty because I hadn't yet created the thank you-page for the form, but was added after writing this. 

- "Saw an end tag after body had been closed."
Solution: Removed the extra </body>

- "Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools)."
Solution: Changed heading to h2 which was what I wanted there. 

7. After adding a thankyou-page to the form it didn't show when submitting the form. 
Solution: After looking at my code and my notes on forms from Code institute I changed method:post to method:get and the thankyou page now works when filling out the form. 

8. Got feedback on slach from John Dickson on my peer-code-review
- There is white space below the footer once the transition to media screen max width 760px happens.
Solution: I changed the width on the section above and also changed the media queries a bit. 
- The sign up form is slightly off centre for the different media screen sizes.
Solution: I used flex and justify:center on the section.
- Would you consider uploading your hand drawn wireframes to the README?
Solution: Uploaded my hand drawn wireframes altough they are difficult to read for anyone else. 

Apart from these issues there have been a few minor issues, but mostly just testing my way through because using HTML and CSS are all new to me. So there's been a few changes, mostly on the homepage and trying to figure out the best way and style to display the images and text.
