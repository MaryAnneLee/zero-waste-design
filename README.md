## User experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Initial information
Zero waste design wants to inspire people to use fabric scraps in their creativity.  Most fabric scraps are often thrown away but could be used to create useful and beautiful items instead. Workshops are arranged once a month with a lot of fabric scraps to choose from and a chance to get inspired by each other.  

### User stories

#### User goals
Make visitors find out what zero waste design is and get inspired. 
Make visitors know more about natural fabrics.
Make visitors find out how and when to take part in workshops.

#### First time visitor goals
Know more about zero waste design.
Get inspired by the portfolio photos. 
Sign up for workshops.
Find their social media profiles.
(To be able to contact with questions on upcoming events.)

#### Returning visitor goals

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª This is my first project and it was made with a little bit of lack of time. The design has been influenced by the ‚ÄúLove running‚Äù-project at Code Institute. I wanted to create a clean looking website with colors that didn't stand out and blend in well with the inspirational images. My aim was also a solid ground to work with in upcoming changes and improvements. 

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](assets/images/readme-images/color-scheme-zero-waste-design.png)

The color palette was created using [Colorminds](http://colormind.io/)


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. 
I used a combination of Roboto (300) and Roboto slab for the headings. I like the mix of serif and sans-serif. 

### Imagery

Most of the images are my own (things that I've made with fabric scraps) except the image on the workshop page which is from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

### Wireframes

I didn¬¥t use any Wireframes this time because it wasn¬¥t enough time to learn another new thing at this point. Instead I went old school and used pen and papper. 

## Features

Zero waste design is a website with three pages.
- Home page, with information about zero waste design and the material that is used.
- Portfolio, with images of items that was created with fabric scraps.
- Workshops, with dates and sign up form. 

### General features on each page

All pages have
- A responsive navigation bar and the logo at the top. 
- A footer which contains social media icon links.


### Future Implementations

- A page about the person running the Zero waste design website and contact info.
- A fully functional sign up form. 

### Accessibility

For the accessibility this was used:
- Semantic HTML.
- Alt attributes on images
- Sufficient colour contrast.
- Marking the current page as active.


## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS 

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- Github

- Find the repository for this project, zereo-waste-design.
- Click on the Settings link.
- Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
- In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
- Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

### Local Development

- Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
- Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing

Chrome developer tools was used to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues while building the website. 

The W3C validators for HTML and CSS was used when the website was finsihed. No errors on CSS and a few errors on HTML-pages but this was solved. See details below on Solved bugs. 

### Solved bugs

1. Menu elements in the wrong order. 
 Solution: Serched W3 schools for an solution for this and found that I should use [flex-end](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_justify-content_flex-end
)

2. Responsive issues images. The hero header and one of the images in the about materials sections was cropped on smaller screens. 
Solution: The third image on the page had a width that was bigger then tha screen and affected the other images. To change that width from px to % on smakker screen changed that. Got help from Code institute tutor team on this one. 

3. Responsive issues navigation bar. On smaller screens the nav bar got hidden by the hero image. 
Solution: Removed float:left on the logo. Got help from Code institute tutor team on this one. 

4. W3C Validator pointed out one thing on index.html - "section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed."
Solution: Changed section to div because didn't want a heading. Enough info in the hero image text just above this section. 

5. W3C validator pointed out one thing on portfolio.html - Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.
Solution: Changed section to div because didn't want a heading.

6. W3C validator pointed out four things on workshops.html - 
- Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.
Solution: Changed section to div because didn't want a heading.

- Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty.
Solution: Was empty because I hadn't yet created the thank you-page for the form, but was added after writing this. 

- Saw an end tag after body had been closed.
Solution: Removed the extra </body>

- Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools).
Solution: Changed heading to h2 which was what I wanted there. 

Apart from these issues there have been a few minor issues, but mostly just testing my way through because using HTML and CSS are all new to me. So there's been a few changes, mostly on the homepage and trying to figure out the best way to display the images and text.
